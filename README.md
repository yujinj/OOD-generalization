## OOD-generalization

This repository contains the Python code to reproduce the results in our paper [Out-of-distribution generalization under random, dense distributional shifts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18370).

1. Run preprocessed-data.ipynb to download and preprocess data sets.
2. Run ACS-income-analysis.ipynb to reproduce results from the paper.
